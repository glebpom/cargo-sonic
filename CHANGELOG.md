# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add zstd payload compression with `--compress=zstd` and configurable `--compression-level`. Add runtime decompression support in the generated loader for compressed payloads while keeping the uncompressed reflink path unchanged.
- Add `-p`/`--parallelism` to build target-cpu payloads concurrently.
